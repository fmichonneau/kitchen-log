> # Ingredients
>

> * 5 small peaches (original recipe called for 3)
> * 100g  + 125g of turbinado sugar
> * 125g of flour (Bob's Red Mill, all purpose)
> * 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
> * 3 eggs

1. cut circle of parchment paper to line 9 inch spring form pan (it wasn't great as the caramel leaked, better use normal pie dish)
2. fix and butter the parchment paper at the bottom of the spring form pans
3. slice peaches and arrange slices at bottom of dish
4. make caramel: mix 100g of sugar + 60g of water, cook until 130°C; pour on peach at bottom of pan
5. mix soften butter and 125g with flat spatula in stand up mixer
6. add one egg at a time, followed by baking powder, and flour
7. spread cake batter over peaches
8. oven was at 400°F when put the cake in, lowered to 350°C, cook for 40 min
9. cool down for 5-10 min, remove ring from pan, put plate over cake, flip it


Observations:

- caramel could be cooked more
- use more caramel and peaches
- good texture for the cake, maybe add almond extract
