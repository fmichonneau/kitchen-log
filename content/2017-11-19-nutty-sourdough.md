> Ingredients
>
> * 500g of bread flour (King's Arthur organic)
> * 160g of whole wheat (King's Arthur organic)
> * 40g of ancient grains mix
> * 14g of salt
> * 100g of sourdough starter

* Mix all ingredients with water (about 2+ cups) in standup mixer for 5+ min
* Let rise at room temperature overnight (11 hours)
* Fold in four on counter and place in banneton
* Let rest in fridge for 10 hours
* Cook at 515°F for 27 minutes with lid on
* Remove lid, and cook another 25 minutes at 450°F

Second half of cooking at temperature too low, didn't develop the nice caramel flavor of last attempt with the same proportions. Could use a little more salt (given that the starter provides ~50g of flour).
