> Levain
>
> * 135g of flour (Bob's Red Mill all purpose organic)
> * 225g of water
> * 75g of sourdough starter (pretty liquid)

Mix by hand (in stand up mixer bowl) and leave at room temperature for 10 hours (all day).

> Dough
>
> * 450g of flour (King Arthur Organic all purpose, actually a mix of wheat and
>   barley)
> * 88g of water
> * 12g of salt

Mix with stand up mixer for 5+ min at medium speed once all ingredients were incorporated, and work by hand another minute or so afterwards.

Leave at room temperature, and fold over a few times for the first 3 hours (in the evening). Then leave alone for 10 hours (overnight).

Shape dough and set up in banneton.

Put in fridge for 10 hours (all day), covered with wet tea towel.

Take out of fridge and let dough get back to room temperature. During this time, pre-heat oven (and Dutch oven) at 500°F, transfer dough, place in oven, reduce temperature to 475°F, cook for 25 min.

Remove lid, and cook for another 25 min.

Very good aspect, shape, and volume. Taste a little funky -- too fermented.
