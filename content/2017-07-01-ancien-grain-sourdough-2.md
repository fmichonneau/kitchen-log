* Mix in standup mixer for a good 5min

* Let rest for a few minutes
* Transfer to banneton (~10:15pm)

* Cooked at 475Â°F at ~12pm the following day in pre-heated Creuset for 25min with lid on, followed by 25 min with lid off

Much flatter bread than [the first attempt](../2017-06-11-ancient-grain/), very tight inside, almost wet. Too much flour in banneton. Good taste.
