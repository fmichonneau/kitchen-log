I doubled original recipe (reflected in proportions listed below) to make 2 cakes. It was not quite enough batter to fill in both loaf pans.

> # Ingredients
>
> * 3 cups of all purpose flour (Organic Bob's Red Mill)
> * 2+ teaspoon of baking powder (original recipe called for 4)
> * pinch of salt
> * 1.5 cup of plain Greek Yogurt (Greek God's plain)
> * 4 eggs
> * 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
> * 1 cup of sugar (recipe called for 1.5)
> * zest from 2 lemons
> * 2.5 cups of blueberries + a few strawberries (original recipe called for 2 cups of raspberries)
> * 2/3 cup of melted butter (original recipe called for canola oil)
> * 2-3 spoons of coconut sugar


1. coat loaf pans with butter
2. combine dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, pinch of salt
3. whisk wet ingredients: eggs, greek yogurt, vanilla extract + sugar
4. incorporate the dry ingredients
5. add the berries
6. fold melted butter in batter
6. transfer to buttered pans
7. sprinkle with coconut sugar (not in original recipe)
7. bake for 50-55 min
8. cool for 5 min, and remove from pan to finish cooling

Observations:

* weird to add the butter so late, it required a lot of mixing which is probably not good for the texture of the cake in this recipe.
* good lemon flavor, cake very dense, rich/heavy butter taste
